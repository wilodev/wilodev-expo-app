/**
 * @fileOverview Styles for Container Component
 * @description This file provides style definitions for the Container component, offering
 *              a centralized approach for consistent and reusable designs. It includes
 *              styles for various size options (small, medium, large) and action types
 *              (primary, secondary, etc.). This modular approach aids in maintaining
 *              and scaling the UI design of the Container component. The styles are designed
 *              to be flexible and easily modifiable to fit various design requirements.
